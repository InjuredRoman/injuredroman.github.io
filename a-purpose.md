			<h2>Why I'm applying myself to robotics</h2>
		</header>
		<p>My experiences have left me with a desire to apply my career towards one aim - to create sustainably. I choose robotics because its complex problems demand simple solutions, as well as the fact that its solutions even when successful will still have questions asked of them by society at large. The more folks something affects, the more questions are asked of it. Those questions are necessary, and I think we as creators have a responsibility to answer for our creations. <br/> <br/>
		Not only creating a codebase, a team, and a robot from the ground up - an exhilarating exercise unto itself - but also aligning that team toward a common purpose and maintaining the lines of communication within and without to hold ourselves accountable to those that our product affects. Professionally I feel its time to begin my growing pains, iterate through them, and use the lessons I learn to more capably ensure that the things we make do not merely rock the boat, but provide both conscious and considered impact. <br/> <br/>
		Through failure or success I will continue to pursue these questions of conscious creation. I intend to make each product, each service rendered to satisfy each market niche, an example of how to not only satisfy a need but also consider throughout its lifetime how we can mitigate its negative effects and amplify its positives.
