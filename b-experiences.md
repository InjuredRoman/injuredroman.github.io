			<h2>Auton Lab, Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute | Research Programmer</h2>
		</header>
		<h5> Mar 2021 - August 2023 </h5>
		<p> With the (incredible) <a href="https://autonlab.org/" target="_blank">Auton Lab</a> I had the pleasure to work with University of Pittsburgh Medical Center clinicians, Allegheny County health officials, and folks internal to our lab. As a partner-facing engineer my tasks varied - applying state of the art machine learning to solve problems, often in collaboration with domain experts; full stack web development when we needed it; and presenting our work to collaborators as well as giving interviews and corresponding feedback for prospective new hires (project scientists and programmers).</p>

					<h3>Microsoft, Core OS | Software Engineer</h3>
				</header>
				<h5> Aug 2019 - Sep 2020 </h5>
				<p>Software engineer within the location team, informing over 1 billion devices where they are in the world. Built up our end-to-end testing suite, covering over 80% of our API surface. Led an investigation into power optimization possibilities, a hairy business with generations of Windows code and power optimizations to wade through. And built some custom software for us to test a custom IoT solution. A joy, but wished to move closer to robotics, and smaller organizations.</p>

					<h3>Amazon Fulfillment | Engineering Intern</h3>

				<h5> May 2018 - Aug 2018 </h5>
				<p>A fun summer in Seattle, working as a full stack developer. Built a search bar to production on a seller facing site, by early 2019 was used by 25,000 Amazon merchants. Built it front to back so ultimately optimized our ElasticSearch cluster to speed up queries 20x, as well as built out the APIs servicing the search.</p>

					<h3>Carnegie Mellon | Head Teaching Assistant, 15-112</h3>
				</header>
				<h5> June 2017 - Aug 2017 </h5>
				<p>I TA'ed for a few semesters but this summer I was head, which meant I was leading review sessions, proctoring and leading exam grading, and holding office hours for ~25 hours a week. Met daily with the Professor to discuss how lecture should affect recitation (summer course meant 4 lectures a week :0). Managed a staff of 9 TAs teaching a course of 60 students.</p>

					<h3>CMU Robotics Institute | Research Assistant</h3>
				</header>
				<h5> June 2017 - Aug 2017 </h5>
				<p>My first foray into academia, thanks to the Summer Scholar program. Working out of the Autonomous Driving Lab I was working with 2-D LIDAR data, and from that created and presented a particle filter tracking algorithm meant to identify vehicles w.r.t. host sensor.</p>
